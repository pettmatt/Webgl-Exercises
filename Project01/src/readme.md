# About the data in planets.json

Used units are in kilometers. Distances are multiplied with a thousand to get the real value.

- Distances and sizes [Time and date -website](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/planets/).
- Orbital speeds [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/ask/which-planet-orbits-our-sun-the-fastest/).

I could have gone and used an api for this, but I wanted to create my own json file for this project.
